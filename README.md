# 🎬 MovieLens Data Analysis Project

This project explores the [MovieLens 100k Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) using Python and pandas. It serves as the foundational step for building a future movie recommendation system.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Loaded and explored the MovieLens 100k dataset using `pandas`
- Performed basic EDA: shape, structure, and sample analysis
- Preprocessed ratings data (`user_id`, `item_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`)
- Merged movie metadata from `u.item` file (optional extension)
- Set up the environment for building collaborative or content-based recommenders

> ⚠️ This project is currently focused on data understanding. Recommendation algorithms will be added in a future update.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset Structure

- `u.data` – User ratings for items
- `u.item` – Movie metadata (movie titles, release info, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the MovieLens 100k dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)
2. Extract it and update the file paths in the notebook accordingly
3. Open the notebook and run it step-by-step

---

## 📌 Future Plans

- Add a content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF + cosine similarity
- Extend to collaborative filtering using user-item matrix
- Build a minimal UI or API for public recommendations
